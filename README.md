# University Classroom Scheduling with Genetic Algorithm (C#)

![alt text](https://github.com/Ilia-Abolhasani/scheduler/blob/master/DB%20diagram.jpg?raw=true)

This project aims to solve the university classroom scheduling problem using a genetic algorithm approach. It draws inspiration from various research articles such as "Solving the University Class Scheduling Problem Using Advanced ILP Techniques" and "Solving University Course Timetabling Problems Using Constriction Particle Swarm Optimization with Local Search, 2013". 

## Overview

The university classroom scheduling problem involves assigning courses and classrooms to specific time slots, considering various constraints such as course availability, classroom capacity, and instructor preferences. This project leverages a genetic algorithm to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for this complex scheduling task.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Ilia-Abolhasani/scheduler.git
```

2. Open the solution file (`Scheduler.sln`) in your preferred IDE.

3. Customize the input data and parameters in the code to match your university's requirements.

4. Build and run the program to execute the genetic algorithm for generating the class schedule.

5. Analyze the output schedule and evaluate its effectiveness based on your defined objectives and constraints.
